# Gait-Recognition
This repository contains all files related to the project I had done on Human Identification using Gait Recognition. I used dataset obtained from CASIA-B Gait Database and pre-processed it to get normalised and de-noised binary silhouettes. Then I creatted Pose Energy Image as the key feature for classification in my project, according to which a gait cycle is divided into a number of key poses. The binary silhouettes obtained from registered frames corresponding to each key pose were classified using Dijkstraâ€™s Shortest Path Algorithm to its respective Pose and were concatenated to generate a final feature. Classification was then done using KNN Classifier.
